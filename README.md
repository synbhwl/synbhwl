# Hey there, I'm Sayan

I am a self taught developer *in progress* juggling my life with my love for code. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python and now I am trying to dive deep into backend development, specifically with Node.js and Express.js. My goal is to either get into a significant company of my choice or make my own company and make it significant.
